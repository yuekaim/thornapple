    <p>Dear visitor,</p>

    <p>I hope this letter finds you well.</p>

    <p>First of all, thanks for your visit. I am writing this note down for you since,
    you probably have guessed that, I am not home. Because of the absence of my host,
    I hope this letter will help you navigate in this space.</p>

    <p>Apartment art sounds like an easy way out but it was not a decision to turn my
    home into a public space even only for two days - where am I gonna hide my piles
     of clothes and dirty dishes?! LOL. But eventually I made peace with myself in
     searching for more thoughtful ways to deliver work in dialogue with each other
     and with viewer. A good soul exercise.</p>

    <p>The artworks are a quick response to my habitat. Perhaps with the minimalist
    rendering of the modernist interior, the addition of the works doesn’t feel like
     an overhaul but rather an update for the way everything is meant to be; the way
      my cupboard has always been closed, but now there’s a morbid transparency to
      the expectation of its core.</p>

    <p>Whether you feel like peeping to my personal life or not, I choose to call it
    a housewarming. I hope to hoard a sharp chronology that chops through the
    visible edge of oddity and happening; curtains and grass, rumble rumble to the
    hands under the bed sheet. As of who I am, or who the host is, you can refer to
    the spiders, flies, pigeons on patrol, slugs, bacteria, poisonous mushroom in
    the garden, the white cat who only shows up during the night, the household
    appliances that works only from time to time, and the artworks on view.</p>

    <p>So enjoy this treasure hunt. Oh, and, don’t mess around when no one is home.</p>

    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
